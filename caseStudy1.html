              <p>
                My case study delves into the designing and creation of an app
                that enables parents to review their children's health records,
                print the records to meet school or camp requirements, and see
                when their children’s healthcare visits are due. This app was
                designed to tackle issues encountered by parents, child's
                guardians and health workers.

              In my usability studies for the digital health record app, I
              conducted two rounds of research to gather valuable insights from
              users. Round 1 revealed challenges with onboarding, navigation,
              and engagement, leading to iterative improvements implemented in
              Round 2. The findings from these studies informed targeted
              enhancements to optimize user experience and usability.

                    Users struggled with the initial onboarding process,
                    requiring clearer instructions and simplified setup steps.

                    Navigation within the app was confusing for some users,
